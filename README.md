Analysis datasets of covid 19  and World Happiness data to determine correlation

The COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University,  consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. I also used another dataset which consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.
In this analysis, I  calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis.
The two datasets were mergeged to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.

The Jupyter notebook with the analysis has been attached
